## Project Overview  

Create a program where a player moves on a grid to reach a bomb. The grid contains a player ('P') and a bomb ('X'), and the player does not know the bomb's position but must follow directions to get closer. The goal is to determine the directions the player should move to reach the bomb as quickly as possible.


## Prerequisites

> To get started with this project, you'll need:
 
- [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) installed on your local machine for backend development.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for version control and collaboration.

## Description Grid Representation


__*The grid is a list where :*__

An empty space is represented by the character 'o'.
The player is represented by the character 'P'.
The bomb is represented by the character 'X'.

__Available Directions:__

- 'U' (Up)
- 'D' (Down)
- 'R' (Right)
- 'L' (Left)
- 'UL' (Up Left)
- 'UR' (Up Right)
- 'DL' (Down Left)
- 'DR' (Down Right)
 

### **Steps to Solve the Problem:**

__*Locate the Player and the Bomb*__

```Traverse the grid to find the coordinates of the player ('P') and the bomb ('X')```

__Calculate the Direction:__

```Determine the direction in which the player should move to get closer to the bomb. Use the coordinates of the player and the bomb to calculate this direction```

__Move the Player:__

```Create a loop to move the player in the determined direction. Update the`player's coordinates with each move and add each direction to a list of directions.```

__Stop When the Bomb is Reached:__

```End the process when the player's coordinates match those of the bomb```
